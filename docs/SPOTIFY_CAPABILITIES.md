**Last Updated:** 2025-01-18

**Capabilities:**
- Search entire Spotify catalog (tracks, albums, artists)
- Get track details (name, artist, album, art, preview URL)
- Get album details
- Get artist details
- Access full metadata
- **No user authentication required**
- **No 25-user limit**

**Current Implementation:**
- `spotifyService.searchTracks(query)` ‚úÖ
- `spotifyService.searchAlbums(query)` ‚úÖ
- `spotifyService.getTrack(trackId)` ‚úÖ
- Used for: Games, Journeys, Community Lists

---

### User OAuth Flow (User-Level Access)
**Status:** Functional for up to 25 users (dev mode limit)

**Capabilities:**
- User connects their Spotify account ‚úÖ
- Create playlists in user's Spotify ‚úÖ
- Add tracks to user's playlists ‚úÖ
- Get user's profile info ‚úÖ
- Modify user's playlists ‚úÖ

**Current Scopes:**
- `playlist-modify-private` - Create/edit private playlists
- `playlist-modify-public` - Create/edit public playlists
- `user-read-private` - Access user profile
- `user-read-email` - Access user email

**Current Implementation:**
- OAuth flow (`/api/spotify/auth`, `/api/spotify/callback`) ‚úÖ
- Playlist creation (`spotifyService.createPlaylistFromTracks()`) ‚úÖ
- Used for: Exporting game playlists to Spotify

**Dev Mode Restriction:**
- Maximum 25 users can authenticate
- Users must be manually added to Spotify app dashboard
- Perfect for beta testing!

---

## WHAT WE CAN BUILD WITH DEV MODE

### ‚úÖ PLAY SECTION (Music Games)
**100% Functional**
- Create game rooms
- Search and add any Spotify song
- Store songs with stories
- Real-time collaboration
- Export playlist to Spotify (for authenticated users)
- All three game types fully working

**No Production API Needed**

---

### ‚úÖ DISCOVER SECTION (Musical Journeys)
**100% Functional**
- Create rich journeys with Spotify tracks
- Embed Spotify preview players
- Community mixtapes
- Community lists with voting
- Search Spotify catalog for submissions

**No Production API Needed**

---

### ‚úÖ BASIC PROFILE
**Fully Functional**
- Show user's UpTune activity:
  - Games created
  - Songs added
  - Community contributions
  - Journeys completed
- Store user's "Musical Moments" (stories about their creations)
- Display stats and history

**No Production API Needed**

---

### ‚úÖ PLAYLIST FEATURES
**Functional for 25 users**
- Export game playlists to Spotify
- Create collaborative playlists
- Add tracks to user's Spotify account
- All playlist features work, just limited to 25 authenticated users

**Works in Dev Mode (25 user limit)**

---

## WHAT WE CAN'T DO WITHOUT PRODUCTION API

### ‚ùå Scale Beyond 25 Users
**Requires:** Production API approval
- Can't have more than 25 users authenticate with Spotify
- Users must be manually added to allowlist
- Blocks public launch at scale

---

### ‚ùå Access User's Listening History
**Requires:** Production API + additional scopes
- Can't import user's top artists
- Can't access user's saved tracks
- Can't see listening history
- Can't import user's existing playlists

**Additional Scopes Needed:**
- `user-top-read` - Top artists and tracks
- `user-library-read` - Saved tracks/albums
- `user-read-recently-played` - Listening history
- `playlist-read-private` - Access user's playlists

**Impact:**
- Can't build "Music DNA" from actual listening data
- Can't auto-import user's favorite songs
- Can't build "Your Year in Review" from Spotify data

---

### ‚ùå Personalized Spotify Recommendations
**Requires:** Production API
- Can't use Spotify's recommendation engine based on user's taste
- Can build our own recommendations based on UpTune activity

---

## MVP STRATEGY WITH DEV MODE

### Phase 1: Beta Launch (25 Users)
**Focus:** Prove the core experience works

**What We Can Do:**
1. Launch to 25 beta users (friends, early adopters)
2. Full Play section (games)
3. Full Discover section (journeys)
4. Playlist export for all 25 users
5. Community features
6. Basic profiles

**What We Learn:**
- Do users love the games?
- Are journeys engaging?
- Does playlist export work smoothly?
- What features do they want?

**Metrics to Prove:**
- User retention
- Games created per user
- Playlist exports
- Community engagement
- NPS score

---

### Phase 2: Spotify Production Approval
**Trigger:** Strong beta user feedback + retention metrics

**Requirements:**
- Demonstrate clear user value
- Show app is production-ready
- Provide app description and screenshots
- Terms of service
- Privacy policy
- Branding guidelines compliance

**Timeline:**
- Spotify review: 2-6 weeks typically
- Faster if we have good metrics from beta

---

### Phase 3: Public Launch
**After:** Production API approved

**Unlocks:**
- Unlimited user authentication
- Public launch
- Marketing at scale
- Social sharing

**Still Don't Need:**
- User listening history (save for later)
- Import features (nice-to-have)
- Spotify recommendations (build our own)

---

## CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### ‚úÖ Working Now
- Client credentials flow (app-level)
- Track search and details
- Album search
- OAuth flow (25 user limit)
- Playlist creation
- Track addition to playlists

### üèóÔ∏è Needs Work
- Error handling for OAuth failures
- Token refresh logic
- Better error messages
- Rate limiting
- Retry logic

### ‚è≥ Future (Post-Production Approval)
- User listening history import
- Spotify-powered recommendations
- Top artists/tracks display
- Playlist import

---

## TECHNICAL DECISIONS

### Use Client Credentials By Default
**Why:** No user limit, simpler, faster

**Use For:**
- All search functionality
- Journey Spotify embeds
- Community list submissions
- Track metadata display

### Use OAuth Only When Needed
**Why:** 25 user limit in dev mode

**Use For:**
- Playlist export to Spotify
- Creating playlists in user's account
- Eventually: importing user data (production only)

### Store Everything in Our Database
**Why:** Don't rely on Spotify for user data

**Benefits:**
- Works offline
- No rate limits on our data
- Can build features independent of Spotify
- User data persists even if Spotify connection breaks

## KEY INSIGHT

**We can build and launch a COMPLETE, DELIGHTFUL MVP with just dev mode.**

The 25-user limit is actually PERFECT for:
1. Beta testing with friends/early adopters
2. Gathering feedback
3. Iterating on features
4. Proving the concept
5. Building metrics for Spotify production application

**Production API unlocks scale, not core functionality.**

---

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH

1. **Build MVP with dev mode** (4 weeks)
2. **Launch to 25 beta users** (2-4 weeks testing)
3. **Gather metrics and feedback** (ongoing)
4. **Apply for production when ready** (with proof of traction)
5. **Scale after approval** (public launch)

This approach:
- Minimizes risk
- Proves value before scaling
- Gives us time to polish
- Builds case for Spotify approval
- Doesn't block core functionality
