I've fixed the button styling issues and created a comprehensive improvement plan for Uptune. The CSS now ensures consistent button styles across the site:

Primary buttons: Purple-to-pink gradient with white text
Outline buttons: White background with purple text
Ghost buttons: Transparent with appropriate text color based on background
