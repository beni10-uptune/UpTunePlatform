Uptune: Vision, Strategy & Business Plan
Date: 10 June 2025
To: Cillian Murphy
From: Shaun Murphy

1.0 The Vision: The "Why"
This idea started with a real moment: a simple game on a holiday that got our whole
group laughing, sharing stories, and connecting over music. It was effortless, joyful,
and it created a lasting memory that we still talk about. That feeling is the "why"
behind this entire plan.
Our Mission: To bottle that magic. We are building a platform that uses the universal
language of music as a playground for connection, helping friends, families, and
eventually colleagues, discover the soundtracks to their relationships.
The Product: Uptune is a mobile-first web app that transforms music into a collection
of fun, social games and collaborative tools. It’s for turning a quiet night in, a family
gathering, or a work focus session into an opportunity for genuine connection.
2.0 The Core Product (MVP): How We Start
We will launch with a 100% free consumer app designed for maximum fun and
minimum friction. The goal is to build a product people love to use and are excited to
share. The core experience is built around two pillars:
1. The Game Menu (On-Demand Fun):
●​ This is the heart of the app. Any user can instantly host a game with their friends

or family. The MVP menu will launch with a range of compliant, highly engaging
modes:
○​ The Mixtape: The ultimate collaborative playlist game. The host picks a fun
theme (e.g., "Our Guilty Pleasures," "Songs from the 90s," "The Perfect Road
Trip") and everyone contributes their essential tracks.
○​ Soundtrack Session: A smart utility for real-life events. The host defines an
event (e.g., "Dinner Party," "Team Focus Session", “Festival campsite”) and the
app guides collaborators to submit songs for different moods (e.g., "Arrivals,"
"Deep Work," "After Dinner").
○​ Desert Island Discs: A personal sharing game that sparks deep
conversations about the songs that define us.
●​ Upon playlist completion, the host can export the playlist to their Spotify account

in one click.
2. The Weekly Challenge (The Community Pulse):
●​ A global, themed music challenge for all users every week. This supplements the

on-demand games by creating a shared "event" that keeps the app feeling fresh
and alive. Eg, Top movie soundtracks; high school anthem; top song of the 80s.

3.0 Our Growth Strategy: The Path from Living Room to Boardroom
Our plan is a modern, two-phase strategy designed to build a beloved product first,
then create a powerful business around it. This approach is shaped by a key insight:
removing all barriers to entry is the fastest path to growth.
The Strategic Insight: A Frictionless "Guest-First" Model
Instead of forcing users to sign up, we let them play instantly. A user can start or join a
game with just a nickname. They only need to connect their Spotify account at the
end of a game, as a rewarding action to save a playlist they helped create.
This model is a direct and smart response to platform constraints (like Spotify's
developer limits). Instead of seeing them as a roadblock, we use them as a reason to
build a better, more viral product. By delivering fun before asking for commitment, we
build trust and maximize sharing.
Phase 1: Build a Product People Love (The Free B2C App)
Our first and only goal is to build an addictively fun free app.
●​ How We Grow: The app is designed to be inherently viral. To play a game, a user

shares a simple link on WhatsApp, iMessage, etc. Every game started becomes a
word-of-mouth marketing campaign.
●​ The Goal: We will create a community of genuine fans who use Uptune to create
joyful memories. These users are the foundation of our entire business.
Phase 2: The Business Engine (Uptune for Teams)
Once we have a thriving consumer product, we will launch "Uptune for Teams," a
premium, paid B2B version. The free app will serve as the single greatest lead
generation tool, as our most enthusiastic users bring it to their workplaces.
Companies will pay because "Uptune for Teams" is a powerful culture-building tool.
The value for businesses is significantly enhanced:
●​ Private Company Environment: All games and challenges are private to the

organization, creating a safe, internal "watercooler."
●​ Workplace Integrations: Uptune will live inside Slack, Microsoft Teams, and
Google Chat. Games can be started with a simple command, making it a
seamless part of the daily workflow.
●​ Advanced Game Library: Access to exclusive games designed for work, like
"Meeting Icebreakers." The Soundtrack Session becomes a key productivity tool
for creating focus playlists.
●​ AI-Powered Connection: A "Conversation Catalyst" to proactively suggest
icebreakers based on shared musical tastes.
●​ Company-Wide "Adventures": Large-scale, structured events that can be run
quarterly or annually.
●​ Brand Integration & Essential Tools: A full Admin Dashboard and Analytics
Suite for user management and measurable insights into team engagement.
4.0 The Business Model & Monetization
Our monetization is focused entirely on the B2B "Uptune for Teams" product, sold as a
tiered SaaS subscription. The consumer version for friends and families will
remain free forever.

Financial Projections (Year 2-3 Target)

This target is the goal after successfully launching the free product and transitioning
to the B2B model.
●​ Target: Sign up 25 companies on the Business Plan with an average of 100

employees each.
●​ Calculation: 25 companies * 100 users * £8/user/month * 12 months = £240,000
Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR).
This demonstrates that even with a modest number of paying clients, the business
model is financially powerful and sustainable.
5.0 The Path Forward
1.​ Finalize the MVP: Lock in the development of the frictionless "guest-first" model

focusing on the core compliant games.
2.​ Launch & Learn: Release the free consumer app to the public. Our primary focus
is on gathering user feedback, tracking engagement, and making the core
experience as joyful and seamless as possible.
3.​ Build the B2B Waitlist: Add a simple "Uptune for Teams" link in the app to
capture inbound interest from our most passionate users.
4.​ Execute the B2B Pivot: Once we have proven product-market fit with the
consumer app, we will begin developing the "Teams" version and onboarding our
first paying customers.
